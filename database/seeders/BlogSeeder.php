<h2>What Is a Coupon Code?</h2>
<p>A coupon code (also called a promo code or discount code) is a combination of letters and numbers you enter at checkout to receive a discount, free shipping, or another special offer. Retailers use them to attract new customers and reward loyal shoppers.</p>

<h2>Where to Find Legitimate Coupon Codes</h2>
<p>Trusted coupon hubs like <strong>THUOC360</strong> aggregate verified offers from major U.S. retailers. Always copy the code exactly and check the expiration date before you shop.</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit the retailer’s official promotions page</li>
<li>Subscribe to store newsletters for exclusive codes</li>
<li>Browse category pages on THUOC360 for store-specific deals</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Apply a Code at Checkout</h2>
<p>Most online stores have a field labeled “Promo code,” “Discount code,” or “Gift card/promo code” during checkout. Paste your code, click Apply, and confirm the discount appears before you pay.</p>

<h2>Common Reasons a Code Doesn’t Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>The offer has expired or reached its usage limit</li>
<li>Your cart doesn’t meet the minimum purchase requirement</li>
<li>Excluded brands or sale items are in your cart</li>
<li>The code is valid only for new customers or specific payment methods</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pro Tips to Save More</h2>
<p>Stack store sales with coupon codes when allowed, compare prices across retailers, and set a budget before you shop. Bookmark THUOC360 for daily updates on the best U.S. online coupons.</p>

<h2>Types of Amazon Savings</h2>
<p>Amazon offers several ways to save: clip-on coupons on product pages, promo codes at checkout, Lightning Deals, and Prime-exclusive discounts. Understanding each type helps you pick the best deal.</p>

<h2>Finding Amazon Promo Codes</h2>
<p>Third-party coupon sites like THUOC360 list publicly available Amazon codes when retailers share them. Verify the terms—many codes apply only to specific categories or first-time buyers.</p>

<h2>Prime Day and Seasonal Sales</h2>
<p>Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday often feature deeper discounts than everyday coupon codes. Plan big purchases around these events and check THUOC360 for pre-sale code roundups.</p>

<h2>Stacking Rules</h2>
<p>Amazon typically allows one promo code per order. You can often combine clip coupons with sale prices, but read the fine print on each offer before checkout.</p>

<h2>Which Is Better for Your Cart?</h2>

<h2>Start Early</h2>
<p>Many retailers release preview deals weeks before Black Friday. Follow THUOC360’s blog and coupon listings to catch early-bird codes before they expire.</p>

<h2>Make a List and Set a Budget</h2>
<p>Impulse buying destroys savings. List what you need, set a maximum spend, and stick to items with verified discounts.</p>

<h2>Compare Doorbusters vs Online Deals</h2>
<p>In-store doorbusters aren’t always the lowest price. Check online listings—many stores price-match or offer better web-exclusive codes.</p>

<h2>Use Price History Tools</h2>
<p>A “50% off” tag means little if the price was inflated last week. Use browser extensions or price trackers to confirm you’re getting a real deal.</p>

<h2>Check Return Policies</h2>
<p>Holiday return windows vary. Know the policy before you buy electronics, apparel, or gifts you might exchange.</p>

<h2>Bookmark THUOC360</h2>
